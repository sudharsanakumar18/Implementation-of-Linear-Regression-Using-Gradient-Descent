# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required library and read the dataframe.
2. Write a function computeCost to generate the cost function.
3. Perform iterations og gradient steps with learning rate.
4. Plot the Cost function using Gradient Descent and generate the required graph.

## Program:
```

```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent is written and verified using python programming.
